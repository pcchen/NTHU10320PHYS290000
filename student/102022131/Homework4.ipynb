      "  * If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point whose `x` coordinate is the sum of the `x` coordinates of the operands, and likewise for the `y` coordinates.\n",
      "  * If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element of the tuple to the `x` coordinate and the second element to the `y` coordinate, and return a new Point with the result.\n",
